# 🧠 **Post-Mortem & Next War Strategy – Kaggle Competition**

## 📘 Overview

This document summarizes the key lessons, ideas, and concrete actions derived from the last Kaggle competition.
The goal: **build a reusable, systematic framework** to perform better, faster, and calmer in the next data science “war”.

## ❌ What Went Wrong

1. I didn’t read and understand the competition instructions carefully (some “Do Not Edit” sections were mistakenly modified).
2. I was overly ambitious — wanted to perform complete EDA and complex techniques — but ended up relying heavily on AI generation because of time pressure.
3. I experienced **working memory overload**, resulting in decision paralysis and random actions.
4. I haven’t fully memorized syntax yet, so I constantly depended on GPT for code snippets.
5. I struggled to synchronize new code with existing notebook cells; prompting became chaotic.
6. During panic moments, I copied AI-generated code without verifying consistency.

## 💡 Idea Bucket (Next War Improvements)

1. **Reusable Notebook Template**
   * Modular structure: `EDA → Preprocessing → Feature Engineering → Modeling → Evaluation → Submission`
   * Dedicated “DO NOT EDIT” cells to protect critical competition code.
   * Add a “Mode Switch” cell to toggle between models (Linear / RandomForest / XGBoost).

2. **Systematic Prompting Format**
   * Define a reusable prompt pattern, e.g.:
     > “Generate code only for [specific stage]. Don’t modify existing variables. Output must include [expected result].”
   * Maintain control — AI assists execution, not direction.

3. **Mental Stability Framework**
   * When overwhelmed:
     `STOP → BREATHE → CLARIFY GOAL → ISOLATE PROBLEM → REPAIR`
   * Always re-read competition rules before acting.

4. **Experiment Tracker**
   * Maintain a log of every experiment to prevent random testing:

     | Version | Model | Features | Dropped Columns | Scaler | R² | Notes |
     | ------- | ----- | -------- | --------------- | ------ | -- | ----- |


## ⚙️ Action Plan

### 1. Create a Personal Kaggle Template
* Markdown section headers for each pipeline stage.
* Integrate modular functions: `preprocess_data()`, `train_and_evaluate()`, `generate_submission()`.
* Include experiment logging cell.

### 2. Build Coding Muscle Memory
* Practice core tasks *without AI help*:
  * `pandas`, `sklearn`, `matplotlib`, `xgboost`, `seaborn`.
* Repeat until writing preprocessing and model evaluation feels natural.

### 3. Structured Prompting Discipline
* Every AI query must include:
  * **Goal**, **Scope**, **Constraints**, and **Expected Output**.
* Avoid “panic prompting.” If unsure, slow down before asking.

### 4. Minimal but Sharp EDA
* Focus only on insights that affect modeling:
  * Top 5 correlated features with target.
  * Target distribution shape.
  * Missing values >50%.
* Skip decorative visualizations unless useful.

### 5. Progressive Model Strategy
* Baseline → Linear Regression
* Step-Up → RandomForest / XGBoost / LightGBM
* Evaluate R², log results, keep the best version.

### 6. War Routine (Execution Discipline)

| Phase       | Duration                                 | Focus                                             |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| 0–30 min    | Read competition rules & explore dataset | Understand objective & constraints                |
| 30–60 min   | Baseline setup                           | Minimal FE + first model                          |
| 60–180 min  | Iterative improvement                    | Feature tuning, cross-validation, model switching |
| 180–200 min | Review + Submission                      | Evaluate leaderboard gap, export clean notebook   |


## 🎯 Mission Objective
The next competition isn’t about luck or brute force — it’s about **system design and mental control**.
By refining your process and mindset, every “war” will make you faster, calmer, and more accurate.
